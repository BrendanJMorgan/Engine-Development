	Add seals to pumps
	Add seals to turbine
	Reconfigure lox pump cad like fuel pump cad
	Update volute/impeller/blade/curves
	Figure out clearance requirements on impellers
	Calculate both pump efficiencies and adjust power requirements
	Add in new angular contact bearings
	Add in thermal barriers


Finish inducer code and cad
	Add in inlet and outlet piping
Start gg code, then cad
Figure out solid ignition system
Run a thermal model and hand calcs
Run a modal model and check for resonance on shaft speeds
Run a centrifugal static model and check impellers + turbine blades
