e pumps mostly
gillic textbook (julic? yulic?)
	roughness, specific speed
diffuser angles, stalling, loss vs angles
fuel inducer assuming impinging on leading edge
shrouding inducers is not that big deal, nor are somewhat wide tip clearances

ross (python library for rotordynamics)
pressurize seal with gn2, but two separated packing seals
zero leakage seal

x or o bearing arrangement

wave spring (soft preload better than hard preload)
tight tolerance on radial part of impeller (sealing) - 1 mm or less maybe
	other clearances can be wider
20-30% efficiency on turbine, maybe higher if load/power coefficient is lower
