 CHECK INITIAL OPEN/CLOSED STATUS OF SELECTED CONTACT ELEMENTS
      AND LIST DETAILED CONTACT PAIR INFORMATION

    2831 CONTACT ELEMENTS &    1787 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.
       6 CONTACT PAIRS ARE UNSELECTED. 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.219   TIME= 03:57:49
 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 548, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 1568 elements     
 for the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs   
 are being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                  

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 12 and contact element type 12 has been set up.  The       
 companion pair has real constant set ID 13.  Both pairs should have     
 the same behavior.                                                      
 MAPDL will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Pure thermal contact is activated.
 The emissivity is defined through the material property.
 Thermal convection coefficient, environment temperature, and
  heat flux are defined using the SFE command.
 Target temperature is used for convection/radiation calculation

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
