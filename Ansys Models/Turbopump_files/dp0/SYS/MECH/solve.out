 Property ALPX of material 1 is defined over a temperature range from    
 100 to 300 which does not include the uniform temperature (22).         
 Change either temperature range or the uniform temperature.  Checking   
 for this condition discontinues.                                        

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       0.469   TIME= 20:41:50
 This nonlinear analysis defaults to using the full Newton-Raphson       
 solution procedure.  This can be modified using the NROPT command.

 Node 35765 connects both contact element 50262 and target element       
 51202.  Please check the model carefully.                               

    5465 CONTACT ELEMENTS &    3314 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.
      12 CONTACT PAIRS ARE UNSELECTED. 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.547   TIME= 20:41:52
 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 848, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 2336 elements     
 for the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs   
 are being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                  

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
