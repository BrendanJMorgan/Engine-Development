 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.219   TIME= 03:42:56
 A linear perturbation analysis with contact usually requires turning on 
 large deflection option (NLGEOM,ON) in the base analysis.  Otherwise    
 the down-stream analysis will not use the current deformation           
 configuration which might lead to inaccurate solution or even memory    
 error.
