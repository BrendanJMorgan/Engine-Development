 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.625   TIME= 03:07:08
 Material property DENS of material 8 of element 8141 is evaluated at a  
 temperature of 22, which is below the supplied temperature range.       
 Temperature range checking terminates.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.672   TIME= 03:07:09
 Material property DENS of material 8 of element 8165 is evaluated at a  
 temperature of 22, which is below the supplied temperature range.       
 Temperature range checking terminates.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.016   TIME= 03:07:10
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.062   TIME= 03:07:10
 A linear perturbation analysis with contact usually requires turning on 
 large deflection option (NLGEOM,ON) in the base analysis.  Otherwise    
 the down-stream analysis will not use the current deformation           
 configuration which might lead to inaccurate solution or even memory    
 error.
