 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.156   TIME= 03:59:59
 Material number 32 (used by element 40220) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.172   TIME= 03:59:59
 The sparse solver must be used if any current technology elements with  
 u-P formulation or MPC184 elements using Lagrangian multiplier are      
 included in the model.  The equation solver option has been switched    
 to the sparse solver.                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.625   TIME= 04:00:00
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.625   TIME= 04:00:00
 Multi Point Constraint element (MPC184) is present in the model.  When  
 performing modal analysis (ANTYPE,MODAL) make sure that MPC184          
 elements are employed with other elements that provide flexibility to   
 the structure.

 A linear perturbation analysis with contact usually requires turning on 
 large deflection option (NLGEOM,ON) in the base analysis.  Otherwise    
 the down-stream analysis will not use the current deformation           
 configuration which might lead to inaccurate solution or even memory    
 error.
