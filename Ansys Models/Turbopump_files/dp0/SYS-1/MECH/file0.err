/COM,ANSYS RELEASE 2024 R1           BUILD 24.1      UP20231106       04:07:41

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.078   TIME= 04:07:42
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.078   TIME= 04:07:42
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.109   TIME= 04:07:42
 Material number 32 (used by element 40220) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.828   TIME= 04:07:49
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.828   TIME= 04:07:49
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 3666).                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.828   TIME= 04:07:49
 Certain contact elements (for example 49863 & 48907) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.828   TIME= 04:07:49
 Certain contact pairs (for example 28 & 26) overlap with other.         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      13.781   TIME= 04:08:03
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 1 of        
 contact node 3148.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.      
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      13.781   TIME= 04:08:03
 Or use relaxation option (target element KEYOPT(11) = 1) to overcome    
 the over-constraint.                                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      15.891   TIME= 04:08:07
 The sparse solver must be used if any current technology elements with  
 u-P formulation or MPC184 elements using Lagrangian multiplier          
 entangle with other contraint equtions.  The equation solver option     
 has been switched to the sparse solver.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      19.578   TIME= 04:08:12
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
