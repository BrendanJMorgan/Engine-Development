 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.531   TIME= 03:28:12
 Material property ALPX of material 1 is evaluated at a temperature of   
 0, which is below the supplied temperature range.  Temperature range    
 checking terminates.                                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.531   TIME= 03:28:12
 The temperature-dependent secant coefficient of thermal expansion for   
 material 8 includes a temperature point of reference temperature (with  
 a tolerance of 1 degree).  This data is ignored for the MPAMOD command  
 operation to avoid a numerical singularity.                             

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.688   TIME= 03:28:12
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.
