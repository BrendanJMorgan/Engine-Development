 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.156   TIME= 02:12:45
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     137.500   TIME= 02:18:16
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 142%.      
 This often indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or a particularly slow hard       
 drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run faster on  
 identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive             
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 Mechanical APDL Performance Guide which is part of the Ansys Help       
 system.
