 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.234   TIME= 17:05:36
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.000   TIME= 17:05:39
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.000   TIME= 17:05:39
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 19308).                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.000   TIME= 17:05:39
 Certain contact pairs (for example 31 & 30) overlap with other.
