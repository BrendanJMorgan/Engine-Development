 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.203   TIME= 15:15:40
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.688   TIME= 15:15:59
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.688   TIME= 15:15:59
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 36091).                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.688   TIME= 15:15:59
 Certain contact elements (for example 149744 & 86834) overlap with      
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.688   TIME= 15:15:59
 Certain contact pairs (for example 132 & 129) overlap with other.       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      37.422   TIME= 15:16:32

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      48.844   TIME= 15:16:53
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 1 of        
 contact node 35277.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.     
 Please check the model carefully.
